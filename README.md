> My Next.js and Strapi blog

### 🏠 [Homepage](https://www.davidblatt.ca/)

This is a blog website made using Strapi and Next.js. All the style is custom made with Sass. Strapi has been deployed to Heroku. The site uses Axios to make network requests. Markdown-it is used to display the markdown from Strapi. Images are uploaded using Cloudinary. The site uses Typescript and I have tried to follow many of the coding principles from Bulletproof React.
